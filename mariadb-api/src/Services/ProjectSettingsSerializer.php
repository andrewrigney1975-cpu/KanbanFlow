 * Ported from Services/ProjectSettingsSerializer.cs. Defaults mirror normalizeHeaderButtonVisibility
 * (src/js/storage.js) exactly: every field is opt-out (defaults true) except workflow,
 * changeAuditing and retrospective, which are opt-in (default false) — a missing/corrupted value
 * must never silently start enforcing/recording/showing something the user never asked for. Keys
 * are camelCase to match both the frontend's own field names and the "changeAuditing" key
 * TaskService::isChangeAuditingEnabled reads from this same column.
